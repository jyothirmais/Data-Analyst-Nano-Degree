# Data-Analyst-Nano-Degree (Investigate a movie database set)
# Quality of Analysis
Do popularity ratings of movies based on High Budget/High Revenue/High Vote Count?
What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?
How various characteristics of th movies changed over time?
how various characteristics varies for high budget and hig hrevenue movies?The project investigates the stated question(s) from multiple angles.
# Data Wrangling Phase
Identified missing and duplicated data
Identified data that requires wrangling to be useful in your analysis (genres and production_companies, etc) and/or would bias your analysis
# Exploration Phase
The project explores at least three variables in relation to the primary question. This can be an exploratory relationship between three variables of interest, or looking at how two independent variables relate to a single dependent variable of interest.
The project performs both single-variable (1d) and multiple-variable (2d) explorations.
The project's visualizations are varied and show multiple comparisons and trends.
At least two kinds of plots should be created as part of the explorations.
Relevant statistics are computed throughout the analysis when an inference is made about the data.
# Conclusions Phase
The Conclusions have reflected on the steps taken during the data exploration.
The Conclusions have summarized the main findings in relation to the question(s) provided at the beginning of the analysis accurately.
The project has pointed out where additional research can be done or where additional information could be useful.
The conclusion should have at least 1 limitation explained clearly.
The analysis does not state or imply that one change causes another based solely on a correlation.
# Communication
The code should have ideally the following sections: Introduction; Questions; Data Wrangling; Exploratory Data Analysis; Conclusions, Limitation.
Reasoning is provided for each analysis decision, plot, and statistical summary.
Interpretation of plots and application of statistical tests should be correct and without error.
Comments are used within the code cells.
Documented the flow of analysis in the mark-down cells.
